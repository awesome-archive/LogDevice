/**
 * @file  A thread-safe class which, for each storage node, keeps track of the
 *        largest sequence number included in a RELEASE message successfully
 *        sent to that node. Its responsibility is to periodically
 *        (Settings::release_retry_interval) send releases to those nodes that
 *        don't have an up-to-date value.
 *
 *        PeriodicReleases internally keeps a timer (bound to some worker
 *        thread) which is created by schedule(). If a timer already exists,
 *        it will be reactivated. PeriodicReleases guarantees that a timer will
 *        only exist as long as there is activity on the log (new records are
 *        being released) or sending to some nodes keeps failing.
 *
 *        In addition to the retry timer which gets activated on a send failure,
 *        PeriodicReleases also have a broadcast timer which unconditionally
 *        broadcast releases to the union of all historical and current storage
 *        shards tracked by the sequencer. The broadcast timer fires at a much
 *        higher interval.
