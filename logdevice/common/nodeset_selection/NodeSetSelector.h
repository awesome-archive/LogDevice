   *
   * @param nodes_configuration   contains the storage node membership and

   *
   * @param  target_nodeset_size  Recommended size of the nodeset to select.
   * @param  seed     Seed/salt for any RNGs/hash functions used by the nodeset
   *                  selector. Nondeterministic nodeset selector may ignore it.
   * @param  prev     Previous nodeset, used to determine whether an update is
   *                  needed. Can be nullptr indicating the information is not
   *                  available. If nullptr, Result::decision must not be KEEP.
   * @param  options  Additional options used for selection
   *
   * Currently it is required that getStorageSet() never requests an update
   * twice in a row. I.e. if you call getStorageSet(), then convert the returned
   * result into EpochMetaData, then call getStorageSet() again on that
   * EpochMetaData with the same arguments, the result will be Decision::KEEP.
   * This is usually achieved in one of two ways:
   *   1. Make nodeset selector deterministic, and make it return KEEP if the
   *      newly generated nodeset is equal to the previous one.
   *   2. Use `signature`. Set signature to a hash of the parts of input that
   *      potentially affect the nodeset, e.g. nodes config, target nodeset
   *      size, seed, nodeset selector type. When selecting a nodeset, first
   *      calculate the hash of the current inputs and compare it to signature
   *      of the existing nodeset. If it matches, don't generate a new nodeset
   *      and return KEEP.
   * Note that deterministic nodeset selectors may still want to use signature
   * as an optimization, to avoid generating new nodeset if nothing changed in
   * the input.
