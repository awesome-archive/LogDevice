/**
 * @file RandomCrossDomainNodeSetSelector is a basic nodeset selector that
 *       selects nodes based on the location-based failure domain of storage
 *       nodes. It takes into account the `sync_replicate_across' property
 *       in the Log config in order to make sure sequencers can always select
 *       copysets that span across at least two domains in the location scope
 *       specified by `sync_replicate_across' from the generated node set.
 *       Moreover, sequencers can leverage the location information of nodes in
 *       its nodeset to reduce the amount of cross-domain traffic in the
 *       specified synchronous replication scope.
 *
 *       Requirements and Limitations:
 *
 *       Since currently sequencer placement is not location-aware, to ensure
 *       that every sequencer can store copies of record in its own domain, a
 *       nodeset needs to contain storage nodes from all domains in the cluster.
 *       Furthermore, it has the following requirements to simplify the
 *       selection and achieve load balancing:
 *
 *       (1) each node must have location information specified and the
 *           specified synchronous replication scope must not be empty in
 *           its location
 *       (2) the nodeset size must be divisible by the number of domains so that
 *           a nodeset contains equal amount of nodes from each domain
 *       (3) each domain must have at least nodeset_size/n_domains nodes.
 *       (4) if replication > 2, each domain  must have at least 2 non-zero
 *           weighted nodes to make it possible to reduce cross-domain bandwidth
 *
 *       Another limitation is that the selector does not consider node locality
 *       besides synchronous replication scope. For example, if the log is
 *       configured to be cross-region replicated, the nodeset selector does not
 *       ensure the nodeset will contain the nodes from the same _rack_ on which
 *       the sequencer is located. Therefore, there is no guarantee that
 *       cross-rack traffic will be optimized in such case.
 *
 *       Note that for better load distribution, each domain should have similar
 *       number of storage nodes. This is not enforced by the selector.
