// A NodeSetSelector that plays nice with weights and WeightedCopySetSelector.
// It doesn't actually use the weights when selecting nodeset, but it decides
// what weights copyset selector should use.
//
// Handling of temporarily disabled (unwritable) shards:
// If there are temporarily disabled (unwritable) shards in config,
// WeightAwareNodeSetSelector may pick some of them,
// but only _in addition_ to a full-size nodeset of writable nodes.
// E.g. if a rack is unwritable, we'll pick a nodeset as if that rack didn't
// exist, then add a few nodes from the rack, ending up with a nodeset bigger
// than target_size. (In actual code these two steps happen in reverse order.)
// Picking unwritable shards is needed to allow these shards to receive
// rebuilding writes after they become available again. Picking a full-size
// nodeset of writable shards is needed to make sure the data distribution is
// good while the unwritable shards are unwritable.
//
// TODO (#T21664344): Weight calculation and propagation is not implemented
// at the moment. The idea is to move the weight calculation and adjustment
// from WeightedCopySetSelector into here.
