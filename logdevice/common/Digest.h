/**
 * @file Digest collects data and gap records delivered by nodes in
 *       the recovery set. It also collects metadata associated with the record
 *       such as the wave number (if written by sequencer) or the seal epoch
 *       (if written by epoch recovery). RECORD messages are delivered in
 *       response to START sent by the EpochRecovery machine that owns this
 *       digest.
 *
 *       For each ESN of a RECORD message the Digest records the metadata and
 *       node id of all nodes that have delivered that record. Digest also keeps
 *       track of the fully record received that has the highest precedence.
 *       It makes use of the such information to determine whether a particular
 *       esn needs mutation by epoch recovery, and if so, determine sets of
 *       that 1) already have the up-to-date copy; 2) needs to amend its record
 *       metadata but no need to send payload; 3) needs to resolve the hole-copy
 *       conflict and overwrite the existing record.
 *
 *       see MutationsWithImmutableConsensus in test/RecoveryTest.cpp for an
 *       example of record precedence rules and how Digest resolves the
 *       consensus.
 *
 *       TODO 5904734: more description about the bridge record.
 *
 *       A brief explanation on why epoch recovery does not pay special
 *       attention to records with EPOCH_BEGIN flag like it does to the
 *       bridge record: considering the following two cases:
 *         1) consensus LNG of the epoch > ESN_INVALID and LNG has been moved
 *            in this epoch. In this case, the record with smallest esn must
 *            have fully replicated with the EPOCH_BEGIN stored by the
 *            sequencer. Epoch recovery does not need to perform anything
 *            regarding to the record.
 *
 *         2) consensus LNG of the epoch > ESN_INVALID and LNG has not been
 *            moved in this epoch. This can happen if sequencer gets reactivated
 *            to an new epoch and gets LNG > ESN_INVALID for the new epoch. In
 *            such case, EPOCH_BEGIN may or may not replicate by log recovery.
 *            But it won't affect correctness or consistency of the epoch,
 *            the worst case is that the reads will fallback to use f-majority
 *            based gap detection if EPOCH_BEGIN is not present.
 *
 *         3) consensus LNG of the epoch == ESN_INVALID: in such case, the
 *            record with EPOCH_BEGIN may or may not be fully replicated, and
 *            the esn might even be plugged a hole. However, instead of trying
 *            to amend the EPOCH_BEGIN flag like bridge record, epoch recovery
 *            can simply just ignore it. The reason is that epoch recovery must
 *            ensure the consistency of esn from lng_ + 1 to the end of epoch,
 *            in such case, ESN 1 will always guarantee to exist  by epoch
 *            recovery by either being a normal record, a hole or a bridge
 *            record. On the read path, the readers can always treat ESN 1 as
 *            the beginning of an epoch since it is the smallest esn possible
 *            that can be allocated. The reader will ingore subsequent
 *            EPOCH_BEGIN flags it encountered for the same epoch, if any.
