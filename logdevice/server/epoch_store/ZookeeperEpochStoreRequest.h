 *       Zookeeper client API calls are done by ZookeeperEpochStore.
 *       A ZookeeperEpochStoreRequest provides serialization and
 *       deserialization of znode values, determines the znode path to operate
 *       on, and tells ZookeeperEpochStore whether to perform
 *       a read-modify-write, or just a read.
